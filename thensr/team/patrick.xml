<body>I just graduated from UMBC. I have no desire to spend my life as a programmer, but some of you want to be, and that is cool.  I run this site at a loss for the benefit of the community and a benefit to the natural wildlife foundation of the greater baltimore-washington area.  All things wireless seem to be my favorite.</body>
