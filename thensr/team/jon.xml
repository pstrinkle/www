<body>I am (unfortunately) in the military (but not for to much longer). I live (again, unfortunately) in Maryland (but not for much longer). I think (for the third and final time, unfortunately) that nobody is going to read anything I have to say... so I'll rant about any damn thing I want... PS - this is what part of the alphabet would look like if "Q" and "R" were eliminated.</body>
