<p class="body">With the new OS looming on the horizon there are still many who don't know a lot about it. After the complete flops of Windows ME, and Windows Media Center, this could go either way. As usual Microsoft is promising one thing when we will probably get something else. They are pushing three major points to make this the new top of the line OS. Those being:</p>
<ol class="body">
<li>"Helping people to be more confident by making the operating system safer, more reliable, and more responsive"</li>
<li>"Helping people gain clarity by removing clutter and improving organization"</li>
<li>"Helping people connect with others easily and securely by improving network security and integration collaboration"</li>
</ol>
<p class="body">But within those three “essentials” are several focal points for the development teams. Namely making it “fun” to use, and giving other developers more to work with and making all knew applications. A new security system, much like that of XP's sp2, more reliable, and better at detecting and connecting to networks. One of the more interesting developments has been that Microsoft is planning this to go into laptops, and having its own applications that automatically synchronizes application data when necessary and detects power and network status</p>
<p class="body">With any new application there is always the concern with “is my computer good enough?” Although there are no exact requirements released as of yet, there are some rough guidelines for a Vista ready pc. The pc should have a modern CPU, 512MB of ram, and a modern GPU.</p>
