<body><p class="body">High-end computers rule the gaming community!  Extreme computing is more often than not distributed problem solving, but that doesn’t mean we all can’t own a kick-ass box.  So the question becomes, “where to look?”  We all want massive power in a desktop computer, but there’s something you may not have realized—money will be a brick wall when it pleases.  As consumers we settle down and we focus.  Should one get a Dell or possibly bite the bullet and go for an <font color="#0D69B2">Alienware</font>?  After some extension data comparison, I can conclusively say that if you have about $7,000 you can get a keyboard-shattering <font color="#0D69B2">Alienware ALX</font>.  For about 6 grand you can max out your Dell XPS 600 and still pack a good punch.</p>

<p class="body">For those of us without an infinite pocketbook, I took the liberty of configuring two comparable machines.  I went to Dell’s and <font color="#0D69B2">Alienware’s</font> websites and did my best to match two machines component by component.  The two machines I chose were the Dell XPS 600 and the <font color="#0D69B2">Alienware Area-51 7500</font>.  The following is that machine(<a href="#art_note">NOTE</a>):</p>
<ul class="body">
<li>Pentium® D Processor 840 with Dual Core Technology (3.20GHz, 800FSB)</li>
<li>Microsoft® Windows® XP Professional</li>
<li>Dual 256MB Nvidia GeForce 7800 GTX with SLI Technology DIMMs | <font color="#0D69B2">Comes with copy of Battefield 2</font></li>
<li>2GB Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz - 2 DIMMs</li>
<li>80GB Serial ATA Hard Drive (10000RPM) | <font color="#0D69B2">74GB Serial ATA 10,000 RPM w/8MB Cache</font></li>
<li>500GB Serial ATA2 Hard Drive (7200RPM)</li>
<li>Dual Drives: 16x DVD-ROM Drive + 16x DVD+/-RW w/ dbl layer write capable</li>
<li>3.5 in Floppy Drive</li>
<li>Sound Blaster® X-Fi™ XtremeMusic (D), w/Dolby® Digital 5.1</li>
<li><b>Dell Only:</b> 20 inch UltraSharp™ 2005FPW Widescreen Digital Flat Panel</li>
<li>2Yr Ltd Warranty, 2Yr At-Home Service</li>
</ul>
<p class="body">Dell XPS 600: $4,483.00 as configured<br>
<font color="#0D69B2">Alienware Area-51 7500</font>: $4,266.00 as configured</p>
<p class="body">The <font color="#0D69B2">Alienware Area-51 7500</font> can be brought up to 4GB of RAM; the Second Harddisk Drive can be 1TB in space; the DVD-Burner can come with LightScribe Technology.  The Dell can do none of those things, so the <font color="#0D69B2">Area-51</font> was not configured with those options, but rather with the equivalent Dell components.</p>
<p class="body">If you look closely you’ll see the <font color="#0D69B2">Area-51</font> comes with Battlefield 2(a $50 value), and the XPS comes with a 20” Digital Flat Panel.  To get such a monitor with your <font color="#0D69B2">Area-51</font> you’ll need to add about $725 to the sticker price.  Everyone will be happy to learn that both systems ship for free.</p>

<p class="body">These machines aren’t the same, because the cases are different and the cooling systems are different.  In this configuration I used standard cooling for the <font color="#0D69B2">Area-51</font> to make it as close to the same machine as possible.  As for me, I own an <font color="#0D69B2">Alienware Area-51m</font> and a Dell XPS Gen 2, and if I were to buy a solid gaming machine, for a good price, I’d get a Dell.  If I wanted to get an amazingly powerful machine forcing me to sell my organs and all other possessions, I’d get an <font color="#0D69B2">Alienware</font>.  The sticker price of the configured Dell XPS 600 is $4,483 and the sticker price of the <font color="#0D69B2">Alienware Area-51 7500</font> is $4,266(w/o monitor).</p>
