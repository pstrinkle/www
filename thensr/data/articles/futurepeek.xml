<p class="body">This year, like all others is pushing technology to the edge of the envelope and further. Everything from huge capacity hard drives to micro-drives, new super low power cpus and and the burned cd with sharpie writing going with the dinosaurs. This quarter Hitachi announced the release of a 500 GB hard drive. A half a terabyte in one drive. This drive will be 7200 rpm on 5 platers and feature a 16 megabytes of cache. The drive is scheduled for release in the second half of 2005. Hitachi also announced their new micro drive, nicknamed “Mikey”, which is smaller than last years 4GB micro drive and has an 8 to 10 GB capacity. AMD spills on the development of its new cpu for handhelds and portable media players. Codenamed “Alchemy” the new cpu will be super low powered, so low in fact that it does not need a heat sink. The 2 in development, the AU1550 and AU1100 only use .5 and .25 watts respectively. Thats incredibly low considering most modern cpu's run on about 100-110 watts. AMD did not state a release date. There is a new cd burner coming onto the market which plans to eliminate the need for the relationship of sharpies and cd players. The new Lightscribe cd burner will work like any other cd burner until you finish burning your favorite mix cd.  This is where the scribe part comes in. You flip over the Lightscribe cd and open the included software. Once there you can choose from a gallery or import and image or add text and start the process, this then burns the image onto the top of the cd. Eliminating the need for sharpies, worrying about bad handwriting, and miss aligning those sticky labels. The only drawbacks are the lack of color and that the image printing only works with the Lightscribe media. Expect the Lightscribe to be out and under trees by Christmas.</p>
