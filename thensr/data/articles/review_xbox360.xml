<body><p class="body">Well kiddies, I decided that I was going to go ahead and stand in line for days, and sure enough I got myself an XBox 360.  This here is going to be a short and sweet one ladies and gentlemen, because there's only one word I can say to describe it, SWEET!  You can believe all that hype, and if you'd like to get a look yourself, head to your local Gamestop, EB games, Best Buy, FYE, or other electronic super center.  I went ahead and bought Madden '06 and Call of Duty 2 with my system, and I've got to say I was amazingly impressed.  I actually thought I was watching the Chicago Bears kick the crap out of the New England Patriots.  Unfortunately, you won't be able to get your hands on one (unless you want to buy one on ebay (which there are plenty going for fairly cheep)) until after christmas.  Additionally, I wouldn't trade in your old XBox just yet.  The 360 can only play about 200 of the original XBox titles, and there are still flaws in the system causing the games to lock up randomly.</p>
<p class="body">On one final note, if you haven't already, go out and get yourself a High-Def TV before you get your new 360 because that's the only way you can fully experience the amazing quality of this new system.</p>
