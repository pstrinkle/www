<p class="body">Since the once huge bit torrent hosting site SuprNova.org got shutdown many smaller hosting sites have sprung up to replace it. The same occurred when the original Napster got shutdown. For those who don't know, bit torrent is a way to transfer files by getting small pieces or bits from many users and then putting them all together to make the whole file. The only problem with this is that users need a website to find the tracking data ( or instructions for putting the pieces together). This makes it easy for the government to pull the plug on these websites. Since all the information is in one location by closing one site, they avoid thousands of files being shared.  Although the creators of SuprNova.org have had their creation killed off in early December of 2004, they are not out of the file sharing business yet. They are credited with the creation of Exeem. Exeem  is the cure for all centralized torrent sites. Although users will need to use the Exeem client, it will be searchable. So you can find any user who still has the tracking data shared and then the user can start downloading it without having to ever go to a torrent site ever again. In this writer and techy's opinion this would never had come about without SuprNova.org going down. And I believe Tyler Durden said it best, “Its only until you've lost everything that your free to do anything.”  So all you pirates out there be on the look out for Exeem. <b>ARRRRR!!</b></p>
