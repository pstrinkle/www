<body><p class="body">Alright kiddies, today I'm here to tell you about the new Xbox.  Now personally I'm not going to have one until after January (but that's because I'm going to sell the 2 I've got preordered on ebay before Christmas).  So what exactly have you got to know about the new Xbox 360?  We'll start with the basic facts.  There are going to be two different versions upon release.  A $300 Core system and a $400 upgraded system. You can find the comparison <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/xbox360/whybuy.htm" target="_blank">here</a> .So at first glance there's no question as to which system you should buy.  The <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000267042765/" target="_blank">specs here</a> on the system are also fairly impressive, and though they're listed as "leaked" specs, they are completely legit.</p>
